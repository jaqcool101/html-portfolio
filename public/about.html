<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  my name  is Renzo Jacquez, i'm currently living in Milan Italy.<br/>
i came here on june 1 2009, I'm originaly from the Philippines.<br/>
My mom decided to get all 4 of us to come here in Italy to have a better life.<br/>
and im forever grateful of her, for what she've done for us.<br/>
Because i would'nt be the man today if it wasn't for her.
</p>
<p>
Today im currently working as a delivery driver in UPS.<br/>
i love my job because it gives me freedom to roam around the city of italy,<br/>
and everyday i get to meet new people and new friends.<br/>
but lately it's been so stressful, it wasn't like it was before.<br/>
my boss doesn't understard the work, risk that we're going through,<br/>
all they want us to do is to get all the package that fit in our car,<br/>
 and expect us to deliver all of them without eating, peeing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  thats why i decided to learn this course so that i can change my future,<br/>
  i wanna learn this course so i can work from home, and try to use my brain for once.<br/>
  im currently learning another program about building an app. <br/>
  who knows, maybe i'll become a millionaire with the skills that i'm learing now.<br/>
  so wish me luck.
